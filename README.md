# Slidify Pitch of Shiny Project

### The Well-Being of Switzerland in 1888: Exploring Fertility and Socioeconomic Data of Switzerland

In this project, we explore the relationships between six different measured indicators for 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland to learn more about the demographic shift of that time period.

This github page is a project to create a Shiny app for the Coursera Data Science class "Developing Data Products". The server.R and ui.R pages here show the code used to render the application itself, which is hosted [here](https://rwk506.shinyapps.io/Project/).

The relevant slidify slides for the pitch of this app can be viewed [here](http://rwk506.github.io/SlidifyPitch/index.html#slide1) and the [GitHub pages](https://github.com/rwk506/SlidifyPitch) are also available to view.
